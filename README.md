* Notable Buildings Section
    - Contains eight images of different buildings around Mdina.  Each image serves as a link to the building’s dedicated Wikipedia page (which opens in a new window).  Using the building’s image allows users to quickly access the building’s information when they are physically present in Mdina – thus using it as a reference.
    - In the desktop view, a transition effect will be visible.  When the user hovers over an image, the image will turn grey and the building name will appear.
    - In the mobile view, there is no hover effect, each building name will be present on the image.

* How to Find Us Section
    - Does not contain information on how to find Mdina, but does contain links to a tourist information site on how to get there by bus, bu car and on foot.
     - As the site is primarily designed with a focus on history, it was decided that this information should be simple with few details.
    - There are three sections each with a button to an external page which opens in a new tab.
